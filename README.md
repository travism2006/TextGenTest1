# TextGenTest1
Using LSTM to predict some text that is to be stored in CSV.

Problem being solved is turning a manual process of writing task outcomes for every single step. This parallels with what I'm doing in my current project at work.
We do a lot of writing down tasks in excel and what we expect to see as a result. Like "login to github" you'd expect to see your account come up, "login to reddit" would show many posts from your different subreddits that you're in.

Imagine doing that kind of writing 90-200 times over and over again, doesn't that sound like a pattern? Isn't that...only slightly different along the way but otherwise...it's the same thing. 

# Important Components
Perhaps the model can be found on my 1080ti but my work laptop is not that powerful so the code and model all have to be runnable on the laptop.  In other words this has to be usable on a less powerful machine overall. That's where the CSV data is generated by myself and the rest of my coworkers.
